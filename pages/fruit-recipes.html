          <h2>Guacamole</h2>
          <img src="/images/ava.jpg" alt="Guacamole" />
          <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1 large ripe tomato</li>
            <li>3 avocados, very ripe but not bruised</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 large lime</li>
            <li>
              Handful coriander, leaves and stalks chopped, plus a few leaves,
              roughly chopped, to serve
            </li>
            <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 chilli, red or green, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
            <li>Tortilla chips, to serve</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Instructions:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Use a large knife to pulverise 1 large ripe tomato to a pulp on a
              board, then tip into a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Halve and stone the 3 avocados (saving a stone) and use a spoon to
              scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the tomato.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tip the juice of 1 large lime, a handful of roughly chopped
              coriander, 1 finely chopped small red onion, and 1 deseeded and
              finely chopped red or green chilli into the bowl. Season with salt
              and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a whisk to roughly mash everything together. If not serving
              straight away, sit a stone in the guacamole (this helps to stop it
              going brown), cover with cling film, and chill until needed.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Mango Sorbet</h2>
          <img src="/images/man.jpg" alt="Mango Sorbet" />
          <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>3 large, ripe mangoes</li>
            <li>200g caster sugar</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Instructions:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Peel the mangoes with a vegetable peeler, cut as much of the flesh
              away from the stone as you can, and put it in a food processor or
              blender.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the sugar, lime juice, and 200ml water. Blend for a few
              minutes, until the mango is very smooth and the sugar has
              dissolved. Rub a little of the mixture between your fingers; if it
              feels gritty, blend for a little longer. Pour into a container and
              put in the freezer for a few hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scrape the sorbet back into the blender (if itâ€™s very solid, leave
              it at room temperature for 5-10 minutes first). Whizz until you
              have a slushy mixture, then pour back into the tin and freeze for
              another hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat step 3. Freeze until solid (another hour or two). Will keep
              covered in the freezer for three months.
            </li>
